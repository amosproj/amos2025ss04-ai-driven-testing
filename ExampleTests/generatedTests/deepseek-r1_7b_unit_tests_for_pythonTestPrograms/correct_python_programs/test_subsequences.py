This file:
1. Contains the original `subsequences` function
2. Includes a Test class with three test cases:
   - One for k=0 edge case
   - One for valid subsequence generation
   - One for invalid k value that should return empty list
3. Uses Python's built-in `unittest` framework
4. Includes the required import statement and main block

You can run this file directly, which will execute all test cases and report any failures.
