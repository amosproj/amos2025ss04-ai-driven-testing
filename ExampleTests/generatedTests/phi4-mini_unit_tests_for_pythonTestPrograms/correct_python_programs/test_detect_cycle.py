Note: You would also need to define the `Node` class used in this example for full context, as it is referenced but not defined within your provided code. Hereâ€™s a simple definition you can use:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, successor=None):
        self.value = value
        self.successor = successor

# You would then include the above `Node` class in this test file.
