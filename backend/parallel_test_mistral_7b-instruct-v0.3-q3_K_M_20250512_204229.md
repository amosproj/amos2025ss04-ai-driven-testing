 Here's a sample of unit tests using the Python unittest library for the provided Graph class. Make sure you have the `unittest` and `graph` module in the same directory.

```python
import unittest
from graph import Graph

class TestGraph(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (2, 4), (1, 3)]
        self.graph = Graph(self.edges)

    def test_make_graph(self):
        edges = set()
        for u, v in self.edges:
            edges.add((u, v))
            edges.add((v, u))
        expected_graph = {1: {2, 3}, 2: {1, 3, 4}, 3: {1, 2, 4}, 4: {3, 1}}
        self.assertDictEqual(self.graph.graph, expected_graph)

    def test_get_hamiltonian_path(self):
        hamiltonian_paths = [
            [1, 4, 2, 3],
            [1, 3, 4, 2]
        ]
        self.assertCountEqual(self.graph.get_hamiltonian_path(start=1), hamiltonian_paths)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

In the above code:
- The `setUp` method is used to set up the graph for testing, which can be reused across multiple test methods.
- The `test_make_graph` checks if the adjacency list representation of the graph is correctly built.
- The `test_get_hamiltonian_path` tests if the correct Hamiltonian paths are found given a starting vertex.
