 To write unit tests for the `Graph` class using the `unittest` library in Python, you can create a new module named `test_graph.py`. Here's a simple example of how to structure your test cases:

```python
import unittest
from graph import Graph

class TestGraph(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (2, 4), (1, 3)]
        self.graph = Graph(self.edges)

    def test_get_hamiltonian_path(self):
        hamiltonian_path = self.graph.get_hamiltonian_path(start=1)
        expected = [
            [4, 3, 2, 1],
            [4, 3, 1, 2],
            [4, 2, 3, 1]
        ]
        self.assertListEqual(hamiltonian_path, expected)

    def test_empty_graph(self):
        empty_edges = []
        graph = Graph(empty_edges)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            hamiltonian_path = graph.get_hamiltonian_path(start=1)

    def tearDown(self):
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, I've created a `TestGraph` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. The setUp method initializes the graph with some edges, and tearDown does nothing as it's not necessary in this case.

The test_get_hamiltonian_path method checks if the Hamiltonian paths returned by the get_hamiltonian_path function are correct for a specific input of edges.

The test_empty_graph method tests what happens when the graph is empty (i.e., it raises a ValueError).

Finally, `unittest.main()` runs all the test cases defined in the TestGraph class.
